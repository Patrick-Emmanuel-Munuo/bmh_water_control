Got it! Since you're using a **Raspberry Pi** at the backend, we can modify the `README.md` to reflect the changes, focusing on using the Raspberry Pi with sensors and setting up the backend environment on it. Here's an updated version of the `README.md` for your project:

# Project Name: Water Level Monitoring and Alert System

## Overview

The **Water Level Monitoring and Alert System** is designed to monitor the water levels in multiple tanks, send SMS alerts when levels fall below certain thresholds, and provide real-time data to a web interface. This system helps prevent water wastage and overflow by providing timely alerts and status updates.

This project consists of two main parts:
- **Backend Server (Raspberry Pi)**: The backend is powered by a Raspberry Pi, which reads data from ultrasonic sensors and triggers SMS alerts.
- **Frontend Interface**: The frontend displays live water levels and system status on a web interface, allowing for easy monitoring.

## Features

### Backend (Raspberry Pi)
- **Water Level Monitoring**: Measures the water level in tanks using ultrasonic sensors.
- **SMS Alerts**: Sends SMS notifications when water levels drop below specific thresholds (e.g., 75%, 50%, 25%) or if there is a critical overflow.
- **Scheduled Updates**: Sends daily updates at 7:00 AM and 6:30 PM to the configured phone numbers.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Provides real-time data updates to the frontend using WebSockets.

### Frontend (Web Interface)
- **Real-Time Water Level Display**: Displays water levels for each tank in real-time.
- **SMS Command Interaction**: Users can query the water status via SMS.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly for easy access from any device.

## Components Used

### Backend (Raspberry Pi)
- **Raspberry Pi 3/4**: The main server that connects to sensors, handles logic, and sends alerts.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Measures the water levels in the tanks.
- **GSM Module (SIM800)**: Sends SMS alerts and receives user commands via SMS.
- **RTC Module**: For timekeeping to send scheduled updates.
- **Python**: Backend logic written in Python for data processing and sensor interaction.
- **Flask**: Web framework to handle HTTP requests and provide the REST API for frontend.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between the backend and the frontend.

### Frontend (Web Interface)
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time updates of the water levels.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling dynamic updates and making AJAX calls.

## Installation and Setup

### Raspberry Pi Backend Setup

1. **Set up your Raspberry Pi**:
   - Install [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and access to the terminal.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Update and install necessary packages on the Raspberry Pi:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv
     sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
     ```

3. **Install Python Libraries**:
   - Install the required Python libraries for interacting with the sensors and the GSM module:
     ```bash
     pip3 install RPi.GPIO gpiozero
     pip3 install flask
     pip3 install pyserial
     pip3 install flask-socketio
     pip3 install time
     pip3 install requests
     ```

4. **Connect the Components**:
   - **Ultrasonic Sensors**:
     - Connect the Trigger and Echo pins of each sensor to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.
   - **GSM Module**:
     - Connect the GSM module to the Raspberry Pi using the serial port (TX/RX pins).
   - **RTC Module**:
     - Connect the RTC (Real-Time Clock) module using the I2C interface.

5. **Configure GPIO for Ultrasonic Sensors**:
   - Each ultrasonic sensor should be connected to its respective GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. For example:
     - **Sensor 1**: Trigger pin → GPIO 17, Echo pin → GPIO 27
     - **Sensor 2**: Trigger pin → GPIO 22, Echo pin → GPIO 23

6. **Setup GSM for SMS Alerts**:
   - Insert a SIM card with SMS capability into the GSM module.
   - Configure the phone numbers for alerts within the Python script.

7. **Upload and Run the Code**:
   - Write the backend code to interface with the sensors, send SMS alerts, and push updates to the frontend using Flask and Socket.IO.
   - To start the backend server:
     ```bash
     python3 app.py
     ```

   The server should now be running and listening for requests.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repository/water-level-monitoring.git
     cd water-level-monitoring/frontend
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
   - Install necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Frontend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Connect to the Backend**:
   - The frontend connects to the backend server through **Socket.IO** to receive real-time updates of water levels.

## Code Explanation

### Backend Logic

1. **Water Level Measurement**: 
   - The ultrasonic sensors continuously measure the distance to the water's surface and calculate the water level.

2. **SMS Alert System**: 
   - If any of the water levels fall below a threshold (e.g., 75%, 50%, 25%), the backend sends an SMS to predefined numbers via the GSM module.
   - If any tank reaches a critical overflow level, an SMS alert is sent.

3. **WebSocket Communication**: 
   - The backend uses **Flask-SocketIO** to push real-time data about water levels to the frontend.

4. **Scheduled Updates**: 
   - The system sends a scheduled update at 7:00 AM and 6:30 PM using the **RTC Module**.

### Frontend Logic

1. **Real-Time Water Level Display**:
   - The frontend uses **Socket.IO** to receive real-time updates from the backend and display the current water levels for each tank.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - The frontend is built to be responsive, ensuring it works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Example of Data Flow

1. **Sensor Measurement**: 
   - The ultrasonic sensors measure the water levels in each tank.
   
2. **Backend Processes the Data**:
   - The Raspberry Pi backend processes the sensor data, checks the thresholds, and sends alerts if necessary.

3. **Real-Time Updates to Frontend**:
   - The backend sends real-time updates to the frontend via **Socket.IO**.

4. **User Receives SMS Alerts**:
   - If the water level drops below a critical threshold, the backend sends an SMS alert to the user.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **GSM Module Not Sending SMS**:
  - Make sure the GSM module is correctly connected to the Raspberry Pi and has proper signal reception.
  - Check if the SIM card has SMS credits and is configured with correct phone numbers.

- **Sensors Not Responding**:
  - Ensure the ultrasonic sensors are properly wired to the correct GPIO pins.
  - Check the power supply to the Raspberry Pi and sensors.

- **Frontend Not Updating**:
  - Ensure that the backend Flask server is running and that the frontend is properly connected to the backend via **Socket.IO**.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Tank Support**: Extend the system to monitor more than four tanks.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for accessing the web interface.
- **Data Logging**: Store historical data of water levels for analysis.
- **Remote Control**: Allow remote control of pumps and valves via the web interface.
