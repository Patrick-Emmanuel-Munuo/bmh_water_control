# Water Level Monitoring and Alert System At Block I

## Overview

The **Water Level Monitoring and Alert System** is designed to monitor and manage the water levels in four tanks using ultrasonic sensors. This system sends SMS alerts when water levels fall below specific thresholds (75%, 50%, 25%), provides real-time updates via LCD display, and offers scheduled status notifications. Additionally, it includes SMS commands for querying the system’s status.

## Features

- **Real-Time Water Level Monitoring**: Monitors four tanks using ultrasonic sensors.
- **SMS Alerts**: Sends alerts when water levels drop below 75%, 50%, or 25%.
- **Scheduled Updates**: Sends daily updates at 7:00 AM and 6:30 PM.
- **LCD Display**: Displays water levels in each tank in percentage and volume.
- **SMS Command Functionality**: Responds to SMS requests for the water system status.
- **Overflow Prevention**: Helps prevent overfilling or overflow by sending alerts when levels exceed safe limits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides easy-to-read LCD status updates for users.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno or similar)**
- **GSM Module (e.g., SIM800L, SIM900)**: For SMS communication.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)**: For measuring the water height in each tank.
- **RTC Module (e.g., DS3231)**: For time-based actions like scheduled SMS updates.
- **LCD Display (e.g., 20x4 LCD)**: Displays water level information.
- **Jumper Wires and PCB**: For connections between components.

## Wiring Diagram

- **Ultrasonic Sensors**:
  - Sensor 1: Trigger pin → Pin 6, Echo pin → Pin 7
  - Sensor 2: Trigger pin → Pin 9, Echo pin → Pin 8
  - Sensor 3: Trigger pin → Pin 10, Echo pin → Pin 11
  - Sensor 4: Trigger pin → Pin 12, Echo pin → Pin 13
- **GSM Module**:
  - RX → Pin 10, TX → Pin 11
- **RTC Module**: Uses I2C (SCL, SDA pins).
- **LCD Display**: Connected to pins (4, 5, A4, A3, A2, A1).

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install Libraries

Before uploading the code to the Arduino, install the following libraries:
- **SoftwareSerial**: For GSM communication.
- **LiquidCrystal**: For controlling the LCD.
- **Wire**: For I2C communication with the RTC.
- **RTClib**: For interacting with the RTC DS3231.

Use the Arduino Library Manager to install these libraries or download them from GitHub.

### Step 2: Connect Components

Wire the components according to the diagram above. Ensure the ultrasonic sensors, GSM module, and RTC are connected to the correct pins.

### Step 3: Upload the Code

1. Open Arduino IDE.
2. Load the provided code into the IDE.
3. Select your board type and port under **Tools**.
4. Click **Upload** to send the code to the Arduino.

### Step 4: Configure GSM Module

Ensure your GSM module is properly set up with the correct phone numbers in the `phoneNumbers[]` array.

### Step 5: Power the System

Connect a suitable power source (e.g., USB or battery) to the system. It will start monitoring water levels, displaying them on the LCD, and sending alerts as necessary.

## Code Explanation

### Initialization

- **GSM Communication**: The system uses the `SoftwareSerial` library for sending SMS.
- **RTC Module**: Used to manage time-based actions for scheduled updates.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Measure the height of water in the tanks.
- **LCD Display**: Shows real-time water levels and volume.

### Main Loop

1. **Water Level Calculation**: The ultrasonic sensors calculate the volume of water in each tank.
2. **Threshold Checking**: Checks if any tank water level falls below 75%, 50%, or 25% and sends SMS alerts.
3. **Scheduled Updates**: Sends water level status updates at 7:00 AM and 6:30 PM.
4. **Incoming SMS Commands**: Listens for incoming SMS commands like "water status" to provide updates.

### Key Functions

- **`sendSms()`**: Sends SMS alerts to predefined numbers.
- **`sendWaterStatusSms()`**: Sends the current water status of all tanks.
- **`Display()`**: Updates the LCD display with water levels.
- **`DisplaySerial()`**: Outputs water levels to the Serial Monitor for debugging.
- **`serialEvent()`**: Processes incoming SMS queries.

## Overflow Protection

To prevent overfilling, the system checks if the water levels exceed a critical threshold (e.g., 95%) for each tank. When the water level reaches this point, the system sends an overflow risk alert via SMS. 

### Example Code for Overflow Protection:
```cpp
void checkOverflowProtection() {
  if (percentageTank0 >= 95.0 && !overflowFlagTank0) {
    overflowFlagTank0 = true;
    sendWaterStatusSms("Tank 0 Overflow Risk! Level: " + String(percentageTank0) + "%");
  } else if (percentageTank0 < 90.0 && overflowFlagTank0) {
    overflowFlagTank0 = false;
  }
  // Repeat for other tanks
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Remote Monitoring**: Integrate a web interface or mobile app for remote monitoring and control.
- **Low Battery Alerts**: Alert users when system components (e.g., GSM, RTC) are running low on battery.
- **Multiple Tank Support**: Extend the system to manage more tanks.
- **Automated Pump Control**: Automate water pump activation based on tank levels.

## Troubleshooting

- **GSM Module Not Responding**: Ensure the SIM card is inserted properly and has enough balance. Check if the GSM module is in a location with adequate signal reception.
- **Incorrect Sensor Readings**: Verify the ultrasonic sensors are properly aligned and not obstructed by debris or tank structure.
